# Technical-Assessment-Project
This is a project that I completed as part of the technical assessment during an interview process.  

## Part 1: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Business Recommendations
For part of the technical assessment I cleaned the provided dataset using a combination of Excel and Python, then performed exploratory data analysis within Tableau in order to answer the business questions within the assessment.  Check out the [Technical Assessment Answers](Technical%20Assessment%20Answers.pdf) for the results.
