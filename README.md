# Technical-Assessment-Project
This is a project that I completed as part of the technical assessment during an interview process.  

## Part 1: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Business Recommendations
For part 1 of the technical assessment I cleaned the provided dataset using a combination of Excel and Python, then performed exploratory data analysis within Tableau in order to answer the business questions within the assessment.  Check out the [Technical Assessment Answers](Technical%20Assessment%20Answers.pdf) for the results.  

## Part 2: SQL and Data Wrangling
In this part of the technical assesment I was tasked with executing a few SQL queries that required the use of concepts like subqueries and joins.  I then leveraged Python to add an additional "Work-days" calculation that I was required to use later on in the analysis.  

You can check out the SQL portion of the assessment and my data-processing techniques within part 2 of the [TechnicalAssessment](TechnicalAssessment.ipynb) file.
